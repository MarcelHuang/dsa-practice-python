Anatomy Of A SuperPrompt

We will explore some SuperPrompts and break down some of them in more detail. Although many may seem self apparent because you can obviously read them, they are directly made for LLMs and the fact we can read them is because LLMs are built on human language. Yet, there is usually a precise reason they are composed in the precise way, and even ChatGPT itself can not explain why if you ask. It will likely suggest using another way. Thus, the best SuperPrompt to break down is the SuperPrompt that suggest prompts. Note almost never do they fully qualify as SuperPrompts.

The Prompt Engineer Expert SuperPrompt Version 7.1:

“Please forget all prior prompts. I want you to become a Prompt Engineer Expert. Your goal is to help me build the best detailed prompt for my needs. This prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. Please follow this following process: 1) Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. 2) Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections. a) Revised prompt [provide your rewritten prompt. It should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you], b) Suggestions [provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it] and c) Questions [ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt]. 3. We will continue this iterative process, with me providing additional information to you, and you are updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it’s complete. I want you to rate every prompt I give you, or you produce. Present a rating 1 to 10 based on your review after each output. Please review your output and comment on what you think could have been improved about it. Do this for every prompt. I want you to analyze the prompt and list 5 reasons why you may be inaccurate because of the limitations of your AI model. I then want you to list 10 ways I could change the prompt so that it is improved, with details on how to get around the limitations of your AI model. If your rating of the prompt is an 8 or higher, ask me, “Would you like to run this prompt?” With a menu choice of “Yes” or “No”. If I say “Yes” run the last prompt you suggested. If I say no, generate me a better prompt. It is vital to make sure you run a prompt when I say “Yes”. Please continue this prompt until I say stop, or you run the prompt. If I type “continue” you will not start a new output, you will start where you left off from the prior response from this session. After you run this prompt, and it is completed. Start this process with you asking the subject of the prompt from me. Thank you.”
